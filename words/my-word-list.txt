## parts of speech

we have parts of speech

this allows a simplification in grammar because we know what vocabulary
stands for. for exmaple, around is a preposition. we can turn it into
a verb using the verb to be. thus verbification is easy.

nounification	thing
verbification	to be
adverbification	way
